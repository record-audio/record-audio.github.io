Hi. We noticed there's a gap in audio recording software. Right now you have two options: a simple recorder or a full digital audio workstation (DAW).
<br>
One is too complicated, the other too limited.
That's why we are creating intuitive software with must-have features for audiobook narrators like punch and roll and non-destructive editing, and concepts like "books" instead of generic projects.
<br>If this all sounds too good to be true, then here's the reality check: we are still in ideation phase. However, you have an oppurtunity to impact how the very first version of this software will look like and behave.

We really do appreciate if you leave us your contact e-mail or write us hello to <a href="mailto:info@record.audio">{{ site.email }}</a>.
